            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group
        of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of
        ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single
        sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section
        in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph
        can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main
        idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest
        of the paragraph.</p>
