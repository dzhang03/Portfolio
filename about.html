        SMASH@Wharton scholar, Danny Zhang, exemplifies social justice and esprit de corps on campus while also modeling the highest
        academic standards in the classroom. “I love to make people feel like they’re worth something and make them feel
        like family when they’re around me. I treat everyone with respect and they’re all my brothers and sisters.” Danny
        particularly enjoys peer learning, “I enjoy learning and being able to spread my knowledge to other people. It makes
        me smile to see others learn from me because it comes to show that I’m able to learn and they’re able to learn while
        I teach.” </p>
