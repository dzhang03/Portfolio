        SMASH@Wharton scholar, Danny Zhang, exemplifies social justice and esprit de corps on
        campus while also modeling the highest academic standards in the classroom. “I love
        to make people feel like they’re worth something and make them feel like family 
        when they’re around me. I treat everyone with respect and they’re all my brothers
        and sisters.” Danny particularly enjoys peer learning, “I enjoy learning and being 
        able to spread my knowledge to other people. It makes me smile to see others learn 
        from me because it comes to show that I’m able to learn and they’re able to learn 
        while I teach.” </p>
