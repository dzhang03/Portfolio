Assignment: Use Google Forms to add a contact form to your page.

Grade: 85

Comment:  You got followed the steps but the form is broken... it looks like you have the link broken up in to two lines, which caused the problem.

You had this:

src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/
   1FAIpQLScbeIU_FRtnrGa0Yuc0i1y63qlGV7bM9yzCZm9NGcibGYv_-Q/viewform?embedded=true"

and it needed to be this:

src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbeIU_FRtnrGa0Yuc0i1y63qlGV7bM9yzCZm9NGcibGYv_-Q/viewform?embedded=true"

(I know it probably wraps to multiple lines, but that's just the way it's displayed... it's all one long line.  Try clicking [Alt]+Z and see the line wrapping change.)
